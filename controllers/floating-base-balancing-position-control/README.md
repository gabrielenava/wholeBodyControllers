## Module description

This module implements a position control balancing strategy. The robot is assumed to balance on one or two feet. The control input is a desired reference trajectory for the robot joints obtained by means of an integration-based, stack of tasks inverse kinematics.

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `positionControlBalancing.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2017b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `iCubGazeboV2_5`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file `initPositionControlBalancing.m`. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside the script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME`) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
