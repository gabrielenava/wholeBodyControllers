## Module description

This module implements a simple torque control balancing strategy. The robot is assumed to have its `base_link` fixed on a pole.

Input torques are the `gravity torques` which allow to perform **gravity compensation**. Optionally, it is also possible to move each controlled joint in order to track a desired joints trajectory.

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `impedanceControl.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2016b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `iCubGenova04`, `iCunGenova02`, `icubGazeboSim`, `iCubGazeboV2_5`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file `initImpedanceControl.m`. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside the script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME`) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
