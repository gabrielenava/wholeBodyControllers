# whole-body-controllers

Simulink-based whole body controllers for humanoid robots. 

## Dependencies

This repository depends upon the following Software/repositories:

- [Matlab/Simulink](https://it.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), default version **R2017b**
- [WB-Toolbox](https://github.com/robotology/WB-Toolbox)
- [Gazebo Simulator](http://gazebosim.org/), default version **9.0**
- [gazebo-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins)
- [icub-gazebo](https://github.com/robotology/icub-gazebo) and [icub-gazebo-wholebody](https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-gazebo-wholebody) to access iCub models.
- [codyco-modules](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules) (Optional, for using [home positions](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/torqueBalancing/app/robots) and [wholeBodyDynamics](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/devices/wholeBodyDynamics) device).

**NOTE:** it is suggested to install `whole-body-controllers` and most of its dependencies (namely, `codyco-modules`,`icub-gazebo`,`icub-gazebo-wholebody`, `gazebo-yarp-plugins` and `WB-Toolbox` and their dependencies) using the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild) (enable `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_GAZEBO`, `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS`, `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB` options).

## Installation and usage

- clone the repository on your pc by running on a terminal `git clone https://github.com/robotology/whole-body-controllers`, or dowload the repository.

- set the environmental variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME` in the `.bashrc` file to be the name of the robot you want to control. List of supported robot names:

  | Robot Names | Associated URDF Model |
  |:-------------:|:-------------:|
  | iCubGenova02 | [model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGenova02/model.urdf) |
  | iCubGenova04 | [model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGenova04/model.urdf) |
  | iCubGazeboV2_5 |[model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGazeboV2_5/model.urdf)|
  | icubGazeboSim |[model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/yarp-wholebodyinterface/blob/master/app/robots/icubGazeboSim/model.urdf) |

- to use the Simulink controllers, it is required to add the [matlab-wbc](library/matlab-wbc) folder to the Matlab path. There are two different possible ways to add the folder to the path: 
   - directly add the folder to the Matlab path;
   - run **only once** the [startup.m](config/startup.m) script. In this case, it is required to **always** start matlab from the folder where the `pathdef.m` file is (usually `~/Documents/MATLAB`). For further information see also the [WBToolbox documentation](https://robotology.github.io/wb-toolbox/mkdocs/install/#matlab).
   
   **Note**: to use any function inside the package [matlab-wbc/+wbc](library/matlab-wbc/+wbc), add the `wbc` prefix to the function name when the function is invoked, i.e. `[outputs] = wbc.myFunction(inputs)`. More information can be found in the [Matlab documentation](https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html).

## Automatic generation of c++ code from Simulink

There is the possibility to generate c++ code from the Simulink models using [Simulink coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html). The repositiory that contains the generated c++ code for the [momentum-based-yoga](torque-controllers/momentum-based-yoga) controller is named [autogenerated-whole-body-controllers](https://github.com/robotology-playground/autogenerated-whole-body-controllers). Documentation on how to generate the code is available in the repository [wiki](https://github.com/robotology-playground/autogenerated-whole-body-controllers/wiki/How-to-generate-code-from-a-Simulink-model).

#### Legacy

Official legacy repositories are: [mex-wholebodymodel](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel) and [WBI-Toolbox-controllers](https://github.com/robotology-playground/WBI-Toolbox-controllers). **Note**: these legacy repos contain undocumented/outdated code, and duplicated or not tested matlab functions. They also contain original code that has been tested on the robot in the past and then never used again, or code that will be ported in the main repository in the future.
