# whole-body-controllers

A collection of Matlab/Simulink whole body controllers for humanoid robots. 

## Dependencies

This repository depends upon the following Software/repositories:

- [Matlab/Simulink](https://it.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), at least version **R2014a** (default: **R2017b**)
- [WB-Toolbox](https://github.com/robotology/WB-Toolbox)
- [Gazebo Simulator](http://gazebosim.org/), at least version **7.8**
- [gazebo-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins)
- [icub-gazebo](https://github.com/robotology/icub-gazebo) and [icub-gazebo-wholebody](https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-gazebo-wholebody) to access iCub models.
- [codyco-modules](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules) (Optional, for using [home positions](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/modules/torqueBalancing/app/robots) and [wholeBodyDynamics](https://github.com/robotology/codyco-modules/tree/master/src/devices/wholeBodyDynamics) device).

**NOTE:** it is suggested to install `whole-body-controllers` and most of its dependencies (namely, `codyco-modules`,`icub-gazebo`,`icub-gazebo-wholebody`, `gazebo-yarp-plugins` and `WB-Toolbox` and their dependencies) using the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild) (enable `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_GAZEBO`, `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS`, `ROBOTOLOGY_USES_MATLAB` options).

## Installation and usage

- set the environmental variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME` in the `.bashrc` file to be the name of the robot you want to control. List of supported robot names:

  | Robot Names | Associated URDF Model |
  |:-------------:|:-------------:|
  | iCubGenova02 | [model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGenova02/model.urdf) |
  | iCubGenova04 | [model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGenova04/model.urdf) |
  | iCubGazeboV2_5 |[model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/icub-models/blob/master/iCub/robots/iCubGazeboV2_5/model.urdf)|
  | icubGazeboSim |[model.urdf](https://github.com/robotology/yarp-wholebodyinterface/blob/master/app/robots/icubGazeboSim/model.urdf) |

- if all the required dependencies are correctly installed and configured, just clone this repository on your pc. No further actions are required. An alternative is to install this repository through the `robotology-superbuild`. It is required to enable the option `ROBOTOLOGY_ENABLE_DYNAMICS`.

## Structure of the repo

- **config**: a collection of scripts for correctly configure this repo. [[README]](config/README.md)

- **torque-controllers**: Simulink torque controllers for balancing and walking of humanoid robots. [[README]](torque-controllers/README.md)

- **doc**: guidelines on how to create/use Simulink models for control. [[README]](doc/README.md)

- **legacy**: legacy version of all the models in this repo, in the lowest supported matlab version (R2014a). [[README]](legacy/README.md)

- **library**: a library of functions/scripts used by the controllers. [[README]](library/README.md)

- **utilities**: Simulink models for debugging sensors on the real robot. [[README]](utilities/README.md)

## Automatic generation of c++ code from Simulink

There is the possibility to generate c++ code from the Simulink models using [Simulink coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html). The repositiory that contains the generated c++ code for the [momentum-based-yoga](torque-controllers/momentum-based-yoga) controller is named [autogenerated-whole-body-controllers](https://github.com/robotology-playground/autogenerated-whole-body-controllers). Documentation on how to generate the code is available in the repository [wiki](https://github.com/robotology-playground/autogenerated-whole-body-controllers/wiki/How-to-generate-code-from-a-Simulink-model).

##### Legacy

Official legacy repositories are: [mex-wholebodymodel](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel) and [WBI-Toolbox-controllers](https://github.com/robotology-playground/WBI-Toolbox-controllers). **Note**: these legacy repos contain undocumented/outdated code, and duplicated or not tested matlab functions. However, they also contain original code that has been tested on the robot in the past and then never used, or code that will be ported in the main repository in a future release.
